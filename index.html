                        <p>With practice comes confidence. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>

                        <p>We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. A happy cloud.</p>

                        <p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Just make little strokes like that.</p>
                        <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Put it in, leave it alone. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>

                        <p>When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. There it is. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.</p>

                        <p>Let's do it again then, what the heck. This painting comes right out of your heart. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

                        <p>Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.</p>

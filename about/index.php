        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>STEM is the sole Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics focused organization on Oxford Academy's campus. Of distinction is OA STEM's hybrid club-team organization: club in that OA STEM consists of a group of like-minded and similarly-interested students meeting for activities, team in that OA STEM takes part in some of the most competitive contests in the nation.</p>
        <p>By expanding on OA STEM's position as the premier, largest, and only STEM-focused team in a school for the most talented students in the state, the team's membership and sponsorship are almost sure to grow.</p>
        <p>OA STEM strives to offer students the chance to learn more about and get hands-on 
experience in the STEM fields, be it by engineering robots, studying targeted sciences, or drilling lateral-thinking mathematics problems - all with the ultimate goal of representing OA well at STEM-based competitions, as well as the marketing to make all of that possible.</p>

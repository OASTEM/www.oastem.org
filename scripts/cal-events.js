If you have any questions contact Ms. Morrissey in Room 206.<br><br>NDT (nondestructive testing) involves examining and inspecting a wide variety of materials, components or assemblies for discontinuities and quality without destroying their integrity. NDT is utilized in a variety of industries. NDT has a bright future both in this country and throughout the world, offering young adults many career options. ASNT is coming to Long Beach, CA in October and has invited 40 Oxford Academy high school students to attend a free daylong workshop titled Nondestructive Testing: Positive Contributions to Safety and Economics. The workshop will include an introduction to NDT with examples of technical application through interactive demonstrations and hands-on activities. This sponsored workshop is free because it is a part of ASNTâ€™s mission to promote the profession and technologies of nondestructive testing.  This is full day seminar of NDT education for high school students interested in STEM careers. Local members from the organization will be on hand to talk to the students and conduct hands-on experiments.<br><br><a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5nR46Lwjli3cVRxZ19JMm5xSTRaME45eTNEUEhyWnpBd2d3' target='_blank'>ASNT Field Trip Permission Slip</a><br><a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5nR46Lwjli3bEtRVUJhUzRxc1IyTF9SNVp2THlqR3gxRWFN' target='_blank'>ASNT Photo Release - NDT Workshop</a>"
